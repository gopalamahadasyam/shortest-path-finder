# City Shortest Path Finder

This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between locations in a graph, visualized through a simple Tkinter GUI.  It's a practical demonstration of graph traversal and algorithm implementation.

## Features

* **Shortest Path Calculation:** Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path between any two locations in the defined graph.
* **User-Friendly Interface:**  Uses Tkinter to provide a graphical interface for selecting start and end locations.
* **Clear Output:** Displays the calculated shortest path and distance in a readable format.
* **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling to ensure both start and end locations are selected.

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Python 3 installed.  Tkinter is typically included with Python, so no additional installation should be required.
2. **Clone/Download:** Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the `shortest_path.py` file.
3. **Run the Script:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the script using:

```bash
python shortest_path.py
